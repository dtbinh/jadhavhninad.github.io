I am a _Computer Science graduate_ student at _Arizona State University_ and an intern at _10 Imaging Inc_ where I am working a Deep Learning project to build an application that identifies symbols (language, mathematical) extracted from HD visual input. I am also an independent researcher at ASU's _REACT_ lab where, under the guidance of _Professor Stephanie Gil_, I am exploring an application of machine learning that uses sensor data (laser, camera, wi-fi) extracted from robot platforms for addressing _SLAM_. As part of this research I have had hands-on experience on _TURTLEBOT3_ , _ROS_ & _Opti-Track Motive_. 

I will be graduating in _Spring 2019_.

You can checkout details about my other projects below.

## [](#header-1) Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics:
*   I have implemented some deep networks like Autoencoders using Keras/ Tensorflow, a numpy implementation of Multi-class neural networks and analysed reinforcement learning algorithm using openAI gym's MsPacman environment.
*   For my robotics project I implemented an IEEE paper that deals with Formation fight control for a multi - UAV system using fourth order dynamics and Model Predictive Control.
