Details about my recent projects and repositories that I am currently working on.

## [](#header-1) Deep Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics:
*   I have implemented some deep networks like Autoencoders using Keras/ Tensorflow, a numpy implementation of Multi-class neural networks and analysed reinforcement learning algorithm using openAI gym's MsPacman environment.
*   For my robotics project I implemented an IEEE paper that deals with Formation fight control for a multi - UAV system using fourth order dynamics and Model Predictive Control.
